ICO PreSale (ERC20 Token) DApp
Build & Deploy ICO PreSale (ERC20 Token) DApp | Solidity + Next.js | Binance, Polygon, Ethereum

In this project, you'll learn how to build and deploy a full-stack ICO PreSale DApp from scratch using Solidity, Next.js, and Web3 tools. I create an ERC20 token, build a presale smart contract, . The frontend will be developed in Next.js and integrated using wagmi, web3.js, and Web3 Provider to connect user wallets like MetaMask.

üí° What I Learn:

How to create an ERC20 token in Solidity
How to build an ICO PreSale smart contract
Deploy smart contracts to BSC, Polygon, and Ethereum
Integrate smart contracts with a frontend using Next.js
Use wagmi and ether.js for Web3 wallet integration
Connect MetaMask and manage user interaction
* Tech Stack:

# ERC20 Token Standard
Solidity Smart Contracts
Next.js Frontend Framework
ether.js & wagmi for Web3 functionality
Web3 Provider for wallet connections
