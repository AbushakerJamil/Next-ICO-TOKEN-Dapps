ICO PreSale (ERC20 Token) DApp
Build & Deploy ICO PreSale (ERC20 Token) DApp | Solidity + Next.js | Binance, Polygon, Ethereum

In this project, you'll learn how to build and deploy a full-stack ICO PreSale DApp from scratch using Solidity, Next.js, and Web3 tools. We'll create an ERC20 token, build a presale smart contract, and deploy it on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, and Ethereum. The frontend will be developed in Next.js and integrated using wagmi, web3.js, and Web3 Provider to connect user wallets like MetaMask.
